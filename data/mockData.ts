It's cost-effective because you share server resources with other users. However, performance can be affected by "noisy neighbors."</p><h2>VPS Hosting</h2><p>A step up from shared hosting. A Virtual Private Server gives you a dedicated slice of a server's resources. It offers more control and better performance, suitable for growing websites.</p><h2>Dedicated Hosting</h2><p>The premium choice. You get an entire server to yourself, offering maximum performance, security, and control. It's best for high-traffic websites and large businesses.</p>`,
